You are tasked with writing a program that manages contact information for a group of people. The program should save the Ô¨Årst name, last name, and telephone number for up to 12 people. The program should have options to add a 
person, delete a person, update the information for a person, and display all information for all current entries. How could you go about breaking up the programming work into a set of subproblems that could be implemented separately?
Describe the subproblems, the order in which you would work on them, and any testing you would do for each subproblem before proceeding to the next.
